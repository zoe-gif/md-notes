## Built Environment

### Environment considerations

- Development control 
	- Planning requirements
	- Building regulations
	- Land lease restrictions 
- Adjacent environmonet
	- Availability of services
	- Local amenities including transporation
	- Subsoil conditions
	- Level and topography of land
	- Adjoining buildings or land
	- Daylight and view aspects
- Use of building

### Physical considerations

- Natural contours of land
- Natural vegetation and trees
- Size of land and proposed building
- Shape of land and proposed building
- Approach and access roads and footpaths
- Services available
- Natural waterways, lakes and ponds
- Restrictions such as rights of ways; tree preservation
- Tree preservation and ancient buildings
- Climatic conditions created by surrounding properties, land or activities
- Proposed future developments

## Foundation

### Design requirements

- Allowable capacity of the soil/rock
	- The lesser of
		- Ultimate capacity for bearing with an adequate safety factor
		- The maximum deformation the building can tolerate
	- Allowable capacity increase by 25% if the increase is solely due to wind load
	- Classification of soils and rocks (from strong to weak)
		- Rick (granite and volcanic)
		- Meta-sedimentary rock
		- Intermediate soil (decomposed granite and volcanic)
		- Non-cohesive soil (sands and gravels)
		- Cohesive soil (clays and silts)
	- Presumed values of allowable bearing pressure, bond or friction of ground
		- Allowable vertical bearing values
		- Allowable lateral bearing pressure for rock
		- Allowable bond or friction between rock and concrete
		- Foottings of minor temporary structures
		- [Check](https://www.bd.gov.hk/doc/en/resources/codes-and-references/code-and-design-manuals/FoundationCode2017.pdf)

- Foundation settlement and rotation
	- Soil changes volume due to pressure
		- Immediate settlement
		- Primary consolidation settlement
			- Due to dissipation of increased pore water pressure
		- Secondary condolidation settlement
			- Due to rearrangement of soil skeleton with the dissipation of the pore water pressure & reduction of volume

- Structure on reclaimed land
	- Consider significant subsidence due to long-term consolidation of underlying compressible material
	- Careful use of on-grade slab
	- Long-term monitoring and maintenance may be required

- Structural requirements
	- Design loads
		- Dead load, imposed load and wind load
	- Underground water
		- 34

- Corrosion protection of foundation

- Foundation plan

- Foudnation design in scheduled area
