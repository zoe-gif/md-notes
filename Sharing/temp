## Measurement Techniques

### Introduction

- Measurement unit
	- kg, m3, m2, m, No., Day / Hour
- Rounding
	- BQ: to the nearest whole unit
	- Variation / remeasurement:  to the nearest one tenth of the whole unit
- Order of dimensions
	- Length (L)
	- Width (W)
	- Height / Depth (H)
- Procedure
	- Understand the scope
	- Read drawings, SMM, specification, preambles
	- Record of all drawings
	- Bulk checking
- Practice
	- Reference BQ
	- Measure items by items
	- Check scales
	- Record assumptions, queries, calculation

### Measurement of Excavation

- Excavation
	- Items
		- Site clearance
		- Excavation (including surface excavation)
		- Earthwork support
		- Disposal
		- Backfilling
		- Filling to make up levels/to form embankments or terrace
		- Hardcore or granular filling
		- Blinding to surfaces of hardcore or other filling materials
		- Surface treatment
	- Measurement
		- Bulk before excavation
			- No allowance for subsequent variations to bulk
- Underpinning

## Interim Payment (Paul Yeung's Workshop)

- Condition of Interim Payment
	- Monthly payment
	- Bi-weekly payment
	- Stage payment
	- Milestone payment
- Preparatory work
	- Examine the contract documents
	- List out Provisonal Quantities, PC rates, Provisional sums, PC sums
	- Abstract value of work for different trade
	- Break down the value of different trade in accordance with the progress or storeys
	- Break down Preliminaries
		- Initial cost
		- Work value related
		- Time related
		- Completion
	- Agree with Contractor
		- Breakdown
		- Date of payment application
		- Date of site visit
	- Check submission of insurances and bond
	- Summary table
- Principles of valuation
	- Value of work done
		- Permanent work executed
		- Temporary works or preliminaries itmes of works
		- NSC work done
		- Variations
	- Materials on site
		- Quality and quantities as required
		- Stored on site not off-site
		- Not premature
		- Value of materials
			- Invoices
			- Contract rates (deduct labour, profit & overheads)
			- Market rates
		- Allow percentage for wastage (3% - 7%)
	- Material off site
		- No payment unless provided under Contract or specifically instructed by Client
- Site visit
	- Time and date agreed with Contractor
	- Record of site visit
	- Check of work done progress on site
	- Check materials on site claimed
	- Check with COW or BSI about defective / sub-standard works or materials
- Payment valuation in office
	- Adjustmennt in fluctuations (if provision in Contract)
	- Check agreed or approved financial claims
	- Discount factor & arithmetical errors
	- Check liquidated damanges
	- Nofity the payments to NSC
	- Variation including addition and omission
	- Retention
		- Percentage
		- Limit
		- Release
- Points to note
	- Omission works
	- Validity of variation orders
	- No payment for financial claim to be paid until confirmation with Client
	- Preliminaries items that are no longer required
	- Potential for LD
