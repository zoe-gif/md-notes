## Measurement Techniques

### Introduction

- Measurement unit
	- kg, m3, m2, m, No., Day / Hour
- Rounding
	- BQ: to the nearest whole unit
	- Variation / remeasurement:  to the nearest one tenth of the whole unit
- Order of dimensions
	- Length (L)
	- Width (W)
	- Height / Depth (H)
- Procedure
	- Understand the scope
	- Read drawings, SMM, specification, preambles
	- Record of all drawings
	- Bulk checking
- Practice
	- Reference BQ
	- Measure items by items
	- Check scales
	- Record assumptions, queries, calculation

### Measurement of Excavation

- Excavation
	- Items
		- Site clearance
		- Excavation (including surface excavation)
		- Earthwork support
		- Disposal
		- Backfilling
		- Filling to make up levels/to form embankments or terrace
		- Hardcore or granular filling
		- Blinding to surfaces of hardcore or other filling materials
		- Surface treatment
	- Measurement
		- Bulk before excavation
			- No allowance for subsequent variations to bulk
- Underpinning
