## Deciding the Procurement Strategy

- Project delivery method
    - Designer-led (design-bid-build)
        - 'Traditional' method
        - Separation of design and construction responsibilities
            - <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zoe-gif/images/master/20221211225816.png" width="250" height="">

            - Control over design
            - Control over budget
            - Bills of quantities
            - System of checks and balances
