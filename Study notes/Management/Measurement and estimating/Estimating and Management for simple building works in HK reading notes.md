## Deciding the Procurement Strategy

- Project delivery method
    - Designer-led (design-bid-build)
        - 'Traditional' method
        - Separation of design and construction responsibilities
            - <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zoe-gif/images/master/20221211225816.png" width="200" height="">
        - Advantages
            - Control over design
            - Control over budget

            - System of checks and balances
        - Disadvantages
            - Longer time
                - No overlap of design and construction
            - Limit effectiveness and constructability of design
            - Relationship between designer & contractor

            - Shorter period
        - Disadvantage

            - Comparison
                - Outsourcing: shorter-term service contract
                - Privatisation: gov transfers the entity to the private sector
            - E.g. HK Disneyland, AsiaWorld-Expo
- Allocation of responsibilities and risks

        - Need for overlap
    - Project scope
        - Difficult to define project scope clearly during the tender stage
        - Likely to have design changes during construction

    - Project owner's capability
        - Experience and ability to control / operate
