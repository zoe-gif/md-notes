### Electrical controls

- Switch
	- Types
		- Single-pole single-throw switch
		- Two-pole single-throw switch
		- Three-pole and soilet neutral switch
		- Single-pole double-throw switch (3-way switch)
		- Single-pole double-throw switch with center "off" position
	- Classification
		- General-duty safety switch
			- For normal use in lighting and power circuits
		- Heavy duty HD
			- For frequent interruptting, high-fault currents
	- Composition
		- Single-throw unless specified
		- Available in 1P to 5P
			- Pole: num of circuits that one switch can control for one operation
		- Fusible or nonfusible
	- Contactor
		- A switch
			- Most by controlled by eletromagnet
			- Deenergized condition is normal state
			- Normally open (NO): open when deenergized
			- Normally closed (NC): closed when deenergized
		- Relay: an electrically opreated contactor
			- Application: small light, siren, indication lamp (lower current)
		- Application: motor, light (high current)
	- Special switch
		- Remote-control switch
			- A contactor that latches mechanically
		- Automatic transfer switch
			- Switch to emergency service on failure of normal service
		- Time-controlled switch
		- Solid-state switch
			- Switch on extra voltage
		- Programmable switch

~~~
- Circuit-protective devices
	- Fuse
		- Fusible link melt when overcurrent
		- Operate once
~~
	- Circuit breaker
		- Break circuit when overcurrent or short-circuit
		- Resettable
- Switchboard and switchgear
	- A large, free-standing assembly of switches and fuses/circuit breakers
	- Provide switch and overcurrent protection to a number of circuits

- Unit substation (transformer load center)
	- Comprising primary voltage switch-and-fuse, step-down transformer, meter, control, buswork, and low-voltage switchgear
	- Usually at basement
- Panelboard (load center)
	- A smaller scale switchboard for final distribution to electrical utilization apparatus
	- Intelligent panelboard
		- Using a cenralized, programmeble microprocessor

### Electrical motor

- Types
	- Direct-current motor
		- Not normally used in building
	- Alternating-current motor
		- Squirrel-cage induction motor: common
- Motor control
	- Starter
		- Manual starter: operated by hand
			- Motor of 1hp (0.75 kW) or less
		- Magnetic starter: operated by magnetic coil
		- Compensator: reduced-voltage starter
			- Reduce inrush current
	- Speed control
		- Variable frequency drive (VFD) or variable voltage, variable frequency VVVF controller
			- Smooth, continuous speed control
			- Control frequency and voltage
		- Disadvantage
			- Harmonics and radio noise
	- Control equipmnet
		- Combination starter
			- Disconnect switch and starter combined
