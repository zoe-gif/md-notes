### Switch
- Types
    - Single-pole single-throw switch
    - Two-pole single-throw switch
    - Three-pole and soilet neutral switch
    - Single-pole double-throw switch (3-way switch)
    - Single-pole double-throw switch with center "off" position
- Classification
    - General-duty safety switch
        - For normal use in lighting and power circuits
    - Heavy duty HD
        - For frequent interruptting, high-fault currents
- Composition
    - Single-throw unless specified
    - Available in 1P to 5P
        - Pole: num of circuits that one switch can control for one operation
    - Fusible or nonfusible
- Contactor
    - A switch
        - Most by controlled by eletromagnet
        - Deenergized condition is normal state
        - Normally open (NO): open when deenergized
        - Normally closed (NC): closed when deenergized
    - Relay: an electrically opreated contactor
        - Application: small light, siren, indication lamp (lower current)
    - Application: motor, light (high current)
- Special switch
    - Remote-control switch
        - A contactor that latches mechanically
    - Automatic transfer switch
        - Switch to emergency service on failure of normal service
    - Time-controlled switch
    - Solid-state switch
        - Switch on extra voltage
    - Programmable switch
