## Conductor

- Cooper, aluminium
- Strand: by twistign together a number of small cables
- Size
	- 1mm2: solid core
	- 1.5mm2 & 2.5mm2: solid core or standard core
	- Size above: standard core only
	- <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zoe-gif/images/master/20220713223513.png" width="200" height="">
- Insulation
	- Thermoplastic PVC
		- Polyvinyl chloride: commonest
		- Advantage: tough, incombustible and chemically unreactive
		- Disadvantage: soften at temperatures above 70 degrees
	- Thermosetting insulation
		- XLPE: cross linked polyethylene compound
		- HEPR: hard ethylene propylene rubber compound
		- Outer PVC sheath, inner insulation XLPE or HEPR
		- <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zoe-gif/images/master/20220713224534.png" width="100" height="">
	- Butyl rubber
		- For high temperature up tp 85 degrees
		- <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zoe-gif/images/master/20220713224750.png" width="100" height="">
	- Silicone rubber
		- Moisture resistant
		- Temperatures from -60 to 150 degrees
			- Even if destroyed by fire, ash is non-conductive and continue to serve as insulation
			- Useful for fire alarm
	- Glass fibre
		- Heat resistant
	- Paper-insulated cable
	- Air as insulation 
		- Bare conductor for busbar
	- Mineral insulated copper covered/sheathed (MICC/MICS) or mineral insulated metal sheathed (MIMS)

		- Latter one always refer to aluminium
			- Robust, can be used for outdoor
			- Require not further protection, can be built into the structure
			- Carry higher current than other cables
			- Need seals at end to prevent moisture
- Additional protection other than insulation
	- Cable containment: conduit or trunking
	- Sheath around the outside of the insulation
		- PVC
			- e.g. four-core PVC/PVC cable (PVC insulated PVC sheathed cable)
		- Rubber
			- Butyl rubber and silicone rubber
		- Lead
			- Paper insulated lead sheathed cable
		- Metal
			- MIMS cable
- Other cable
	- Flexible cord
		- Flexible, cross-sectional area < 4mm2
		- Application
			- Suspending luminaires
			- Portable domestic appliances with low power consumption
		- PVC/PVC; rubber insulated cotton braiding
	- Enhanced fire performance
		- Cable fault to ignite adjacent materiakl instead of own insulation
		- XLPE insulated LSF sheathed
			- LSF: compound with low smoke and fume property
		- EPR insulated HOFR sheathed
			- HOFR: elastomer with heat and oil resistance and flame retardance
	- Co-axial cable
		- Metal cover over the insulation to screen from unwanted signal
		- For TV and radio distribution system

### Wiring

- Conduit
	- Material
		- Plastic
		- Steel
			- Light gauge
			- Heavy gauge: more frequently used
	- Standard finish
		- Black enamel
		- Galvanized
			- For damp environment, FRP & ELV system for security and data
	- Joining types
		- Seamless conduit
			- Join by extrusion
			- Better quality
		- Welded conduit
			- Join by rolling sheet and welding it along the longitudinal joint
		- By screwed fittings
			- <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zoe-gif/images/master/20220714171047.png" width="300" height="">
	- Size
		- Measured by nominal bore, same as the outise diameter
	- Conduit can be used as earth continuity conductor
	- Fixed and flexible
		- Fixed: terminate in an outlet box in the wall or on the surface of the wall
		- Flexible: from the box to the equipment
			- Corrugated structure, can take a gentle curve
			- Cannot be used as a protective conductor
				- A separate circuit protective conductor mush be run
				- Inside or outside the conduit, bonded by clamp
			- <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zoe-gif/images/master/20220714174136.png" width="300" height="">
	- Installation
		- Must be completely installed before pulling into cables
		- Intended to be rewirable
			- Length of conduit between successive draw-in boxes <10m
			- <= 2 right-angle bends between successive boxes
		- Large conduit: need bending machine
		- Required diameter of conduit
			- Ref to space factor
				- $ space \, factor = \frac{total \,cross \, sectional \, area \, of \, cables}{internal \, cross \, sectional \, area \, of \, conduit} * 100%$
				- Space factor < 40%
		- Prevent condensation
			- Well ventilated
			- Swab throught the conduit before drawing cables in


### Below floor/ground cabling

- Enclosure to provide protection
- For underground
	- Trench covered with concrete or steel slab
	- High strength galvanized-steel conduit cast into floor screed

### Cable tray, basket and ladder

- Provide continuous support and mechnical strength
- Basket is lighter and easier to install

### Cable clips

- Clip cable to the ceiling slab or wall
- No need cable tray or basket
- When no heavy cable

### Conduit (cable containment)

- Pipe for distribution of small diameter cables
- Plastic or steel

### Trunking (cable containment)

- Rectangular, surface mounted enclosure to carry cables
- Plastic or steel

### Modular wiring

- Prefabriated wiring, avoid the need for conduit
- Simply plug-and-play from the distribution board to the final circuit
