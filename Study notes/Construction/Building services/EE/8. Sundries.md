### Fire detection and alarm system

- Category
	- Automatic system intended for the protection of life
	- Manul system without automatic fire detector
	- Automatic system intended for the protection of property
- Addressable system
	- Receive and identify signals from each detector or call point
	- Addressable analogue system
		- Analogue signal
			- Output signal from each detector varies in proportion to the level of the smoke, heat or flame
			- Advantage
				- Give early indicaton of fire
				- Can be logged and automatically identified
				- Reduce false alarm
	- Control panel
		- Provide user interface
		- Usu. located near main entrance to the building
		- Function	
			- Monitor status of detectors and call points
			- Activate sounder in case of alarm; and silence
			- Indicate signal zone
			- Indicate faults of public address and detector
			- Indicate condition of backup power supply
	- Repeater panel
		- Sub-control panel for zone

- Zoning
	- For quickly indentify alarm location
- Detector
	- Linear heat detection cable
		- To detect changes in tempertur along the whole length of the installed cable
		- Application
			- Service tunnel, escalator, cable racking, warehouse storage system
	- Point detector
		- To detect smoke, flame, or changes in temperature within the vicinity of the detector
		- Type of detector
			- Fixed temperature heat detector
			- Rate-of-rise heat detector
			- Flame detector
			- Optical smoke detector
			- Ionisation samoke detector
			- Aspirating smoke detector
- Sounder
	-  Sounder line-testing
		- Integrity of the wiring that links the sounders is continuously monitored by the control panel
	- Voice evacuation system
	- Two-wire system
		- One circuit combines detector and sounder
		- Reduce installation cost
	- Tactile alarm system
		-	For impaied hearing
- Call points
	- Call point to trigger an alarm condition
	-	Manual call point: e.g. break glass unit
- Fire resistance cable
	- Mineral insulated cable (MICC)
	- Soft-skinned cable
