# Deciding the Procurement Strategy

## Project delivery method

- Designer-led (design-bid-build)
    - 'Traditional' method
    - Separation of design and construction responsibilities
        - <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zoe-gif/images/master/20221211225816.png" width="250" height="">
    - Advantages
        - Control over design
        - Control over budget
        - Bills of quantities
        - System of checks and balances
    - Disadvantages
        - Longer time
            - No overlap of design and construction
        - Limit effectiveness and constructability of design
        - Relationship between designer & contractor

- Management Contracting
    - Engage a management contractor at the design stage
        - <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zoe-gif/images/master/20221211225907.png" width="300" height="">
    - Local practice
        - Many owners will requires management contractor to sign works contracts, and ask each works contractor to provide a warranty to the owner
    - Advantages
        - Shortened period
            - Award and commence different work packages at different times before the completion of design
        - Flexibility
            - Owner can change design of packages that have not yet commenced
        - Integration of contractor's knowledge into deign stage
    - Disadvantages

        - Uncertainty of total project cost
        - Owner has to assume all risks for project shedule and cost
        - More administration and communication required for the owner
            - Enter into multiple works contracts
- Design and Build (D&B)
    - Engage a single party
        - <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zoe-gif/images/master/20221211230720.png" width="250" height="">
        - Tender
            - Owner to provide the project/client's brief

    - Advantages
        - One party responsible for design and construction
        - Agreed project cost with greater certainty
        - Reduce dispute between the designer and the builder
        - Improve buildability

        - Hard to compare bids
        - Design quality
- Design, Build and Operate (DBO)
    - Contractor responsible for DBO
        - <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zoe-gif/images/master/20221211231621.png" width=300" height="">

        - <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zoe-gif/images/master/20221211232158.png" width="350" height="">
        - Used in publid projecjts like tunnels and toll highways
        - Project originator, usually the government, becomes a service buyer
        - Local practice
            - Build-operate-transfer (BOT)
            - Gov enters into a franchise agreement with a private sector, usually a consortium, to finance, develop and operate a facility over a franchise period
            - After the franchise period, the facility will be transferred at no cost to gov
            - E.g. Western Harbour Tunnel
    - Advantages
        - Reduce project originator's funding
        - Efficient way to privatise a public service
    - Disadvantages
        - More expensive

            - Share of risks and revenue
            - Forms can be D&B, BOT, DBO, DBFO
        - Comparison
            - Outsourcing: shorter-term service contract
            - Privatisation: gov transfers the entity to the private sector
        - E.g. HK Disneyland, AsiaWorld-Expo
- Allocation of responsibilities and risks
    - <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zoe-gif/images/master/20221211233435.png" width="600" height="">
- Selection of project delivery options
    - Schedule
        - Time for design
        - Need for overlap
    - Project scope
        - Difficult to define project scope clearly during the tender stage
        - Likely to have design changes during construction
        - Buildability
    - Project owner's capability
        - Experience and ability to control / operate
    - Contract arrangement
        - Direct or indirect control over design / construction
    - Legal / funding concerns
        - Public accountability

- Method
     - Single-rate approximate estimating

# Measuring quantities

## Principles and rules of taking-off

- Standard Method of Measurement (SMM)
- Dimension paper

    - <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zoe-gif/images/master/20221218232452.png" width="600" height="">
    - In order of length, breadth (width), depth (height)
    - In metre to two decimal places
- Measurement unit
    - Linear: m
    - Area: $m^2$
    - Volume: $m^3$
    - Weight: kg
    - EnumeratedL nr / set
    - Time: days / hours
    - Itemised: item
- Rules of taking-off
    - Net measurement
        - No adjustment for waste etc.
        - Voids should be deducted unless waived by the minimum deduction rules in SMM
        - Voids at the boundaries always deducted irrespective of size
    - Use of hyphen
        - '200 - 300mm' means 'exceed 200mm but not exceed 300mm'
    - Signposting and waste calculation
        - Waste calculations and explanatory notes entered into the description column
        - <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zoe-gif/images/master/20221218233830.png" width="600" height="">
    - Timesing
        - Where dimensions are repeated
    - Dotting-on
        - Where two factors of multiplication are to be added
        - <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zoe-gif/images/master/20221218234220.png" width="600" height="">
    - Deductions and anding-on
        - 'Ddt' means 'deduct'
        - '&' for items correspond to the same bracketed dimensions
    - Abbreviations for description
- Use of schedules
    - <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zoe-gif/images/master/20221218235135.png" width="600" height="">
- Taking-off procedures
    - Identify the subject of measurement
        - BQ, material procurement, variation
    - Compile drawings and documents
    - Check discrepancies or missing information
        - Query to Architect
    - Read relevant SMM and preambles
    - Plan take-off sequence
    - Colour or mark on measured items on drawings
    - Bulk check the dimensions

## Measurement techniques

- Girths and mean girth
    - Calculation
        - Overall first then deduct
        - <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zoe-gif/images/master/20221218235747.png" width="500" height="">
        - Measured from external face: deduct ext. corners (+ 4 x 2c)
        - Measured from internal face: add ext. corners (- 4 x 2c)
        - <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zoe-gif/images/master/20221219000104.png" width="500" height="">
        - Set-back no effect
        - Recess: add twice the depth of the recess (2a)
        - <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zoe-gif/images/master/20221219000120.png" width="600" height="">
        - An external corner can balance an internal corner
        - Set-back / recess no effect to numbers of ext. corners
        - Always 4 ext. corners
    - Application
        - Volume of concrete wall = mean girth x thickness x height
        - Area of formwork to concrete wall = 2 x mean girth x height
- Measurement of irregular areas
    - Divide the irregular area into triangles and rectangles
        - <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zoe-gif/images/master/20221219003545.png" width="500" height="">
    - Simpson's rule
        - Divide into equal spacing segments
        - Use three points to form approximate boundary

        - <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zoe-gif/images/master/20221219003929.png" width="500" height="">
    - Trapezoidal rule
        - Shaded area = (width of interval) x [sum of first and last ordinate /2 + sum of remaining ordinates]
- Measurement of irregular volumes
    - Divide the volume into regular volumes
    - Simpson's rule
        - <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zoe-gif/images/master/20221219010413.png" width="400" height="">
    - Trapezoidal rule
        - No restriction on the number of sections divided
    - Grid method
        - To calulate the volume of cut and fill on a sloping site
        - Average existing level
            - <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zoe-gif/images/master/20221219011658.png" width="500" height="">
            - Average existing level = 62.7 / 24
        - Average depth of excavation = average existing level - formation level
        - Volume of excavation = area x average depth of excavation
